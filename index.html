                                bootcamp
                                and this is a website about me. That picture...yeah that's me. I know. You're shocked.
                                Everyone says I look different in pictures than do in real life. This is my about me
                                page. If you head over the the portfolio page you will see a beautiful selection of
                                golden retrievers which serve as portals to the work I have created in bootcamp.</p>

                <p>One of my favorite song passages is "All hail the king whose castle's falling down. The paper
                    prince who wears a cardboard crown. Poor man has his money, rich man has his gold. All hail the
                    king whose
                    fortune is his soul" to me this song means that even if on the outside people may not think you
                    are
                    their vision of sucessful as long as you are kind and have good intentions in everything you do
                    you
                    will love your life</p>
